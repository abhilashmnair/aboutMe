<b>Rules to check before opening a pull request</b>

---

- Make sure you enter your information in `data.json` file
  ```
  EXAMPLE :

    "<YOUR_USERNAME>" : {
        "instagram" : "<YOUR HANDLE>",
        "whatsapp" : "", #leave it blank if you don't need the field
    }
  ```

- Check if the **username** is already used in `data.json`
- Each pull request **MUST ONLY** contain **ONE ENTRY**.
- Give a short descriptive commit title. Eg. `Updated File` :x:, `Added data in file`, `Fixed Typos`, `Added Documentaion` :white_check_mark:
- Pull requests must be having a similar descriptive title.

That's it! Wait for the PR to be reviewed and merged into the repository.
